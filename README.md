In this project, I create a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter."


I usesd JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.
The playerâ€™s goal is to guess all the letters in a hidden, random phrase. At the beginning, the player only sees the number of letters and words in the phrase, represented by blank boxes on the screen.
The player clicks an onscreen keyboard to guess letters in the phrase.The letter is disabled on the onscreen keyboard and a player can't select that letter again.
If the selected letter is in the phrase at least once, the letter and its position in the phrase is highlighted on screen. All instances of the letter are made visible
(so if there are 3 A's, all of the A's in the phrase appear at once).
If the selected letter is not in the phrase, one of the player's hearts in the scoreboard is changed from a "live" heart to a "lost" heart.
The player keeps choosing letters until they reveal all the letters in the phrase, or they make five incorrect guesses



I added an element in the project to allow the player to press their physical keyboard as an option instead of only clicking the onscreen keyboard.
Only if the player presses the physical keyboard and presses a wrong letter that is not in the phrase will a style change that I created be triggered.
The style change I created changes the entire screen to pink and displays a message to the player instructing them the letter pressed was a wrong guess.
